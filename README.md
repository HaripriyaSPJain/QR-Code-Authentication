# QR Code Authentication: Detecting Original vs. Counterfeit Prints

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on detecting counterfeit QR codes by distinguishing between:
- **First Prints (Original QR Codes)**
- **Second Prints (Counterfeit QR Codes)**

Using **Machine Learning (Random Forest)** and **Deep Learning (CNN)**, the system accurately classifies QR codes based on **copy detection patterns (CDPs)**. The dataset consists of images of **first prints (originals) and second prints (scanned & reprinted copies).**

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset contains:
- **First Print:** Original QR codes with embedded copy detection patterns.
- **Second Print:** Counterfeit versions created by scanning and reprinting the original QR codes.
